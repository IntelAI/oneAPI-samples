    "\n",
    "PyTorch* is a very popular framework for deep learning, while also compute-heavy package demanding perfromance optimizations. Intel and Facebook* having been collaborating to boost PyTorch* Performance for Intel hardware which includes [Intel GPUs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/discrete-gpus/data-center-gpu.html) and [Intel CPUs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/processors.html). The official PyTorch has been optimized using oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) primitives by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deliver the latest and greatest  optimizations, Intel® Optimizations for Pytorch offers accelerations beyond the stock Pytorch via **Intel® Extension for PyTorch***(IPEX). IPEX is a Python package to extend the official PyTorch with optimizations for extra performance boost on Intel hardware. Most of the optimizations will be included in stock PyTorch releases eventually, and the intention of the extension is to deliver up-to-date features and optimizations for PyTorch on Intel hardware, examples include AVX-512 Vector Neural Network Instructions (AVX512 VNNI) and Intel® Advanced Matrix Extensions (Intel® AMX).\n",
